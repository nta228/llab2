    never been. Luckily, I'm here to give you an insider's guide and make your first<br>

<h2>"Getting Tickets & Picking the Shows"</h2>
<P>If you're lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag. But I wasn't<br>
    so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I'm here to help you out. First, plan out<br>
    which shows are most important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie:<br>
    SET A BUDGET. If you're worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you<br>
    won't have fun. Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers<br>
    you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!</P>

<h2>"Dressing for the Shows"</h2>
<p>Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don't you'll be uncomfortable the<br>
    whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and<br>
    taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their new lines. Also<br>
    it's important to wear shoes you'll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to<br>
    look good, but you'll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared</p>
